### About Me
I build the cloud systems that make presence possible at scale‚Äîlow-latency content delivery with CloudFront and Route 53, real-time interactivity through serverless APIs, and resilient multi-region architectures for uninterrupted access. Each pinned project includes diagrams and a portfolio brief written for both technical and non-technical readers. My focus is not just infrastructure that works, but infrastructure that communicates‚Äîplatforms that let immersive media truly connect global audiences.
